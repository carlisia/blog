## Podcasting

### As host

* When I started learning Kubernetes and didn't find a podcast show that explained Kubernetes concepts, features, and how it mapped to existing technologies, I created one. An effort that started at Heptio and launched via VMware, I am grateful for having had the support from many people who also thought it was a great idea. If you'd like to listen and subscribe, check out [The Podlets Podcast](https://thepodlets.io/).

* I co-hosted the **[Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime)** podcast show alongside the wonderful human beings [Erik St. Martin](https://twitter.com/erikstmartin) and [Brian Ketelsen](https://twitter.com/bketelsen) from 2016 until 2018 (episodes 1 to 79).
