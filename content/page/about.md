# Things I Do



### Some community building
* I am a founding member of <a href="http://golangbridge.org" target="_blank" title="gobridge">GoBridge</a> , a non-profit organization that focuses on programming education using Go: we work to ensure that groups of underrepresented people and people with limited access to technology have as much an opportunity to teach and learn Go as anyone else.</br>
* I host the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sdgophers/" target="_blank" title="sdgophers">North County San Diego Gophers meetup</a>. </br>
