## Hello ðŸ‘‹

**[[Carlisia Campos|I AM]]** a software engineer with deep expertise in [[computer science/go/go|Go]], Kubernetes/Cloud Native technologies, and open source. As a former engineer and maintainer of the [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) and [Knative](https://github.com/knative) open source projects, I've led efforts to enhance scalability, resilience, and developer experience in complex distributed systems.

I spend a lot of time thinking about how the future is being decided right now. We all have a chance to participate, influence, and even contribute to building it.

I hope you enjoy thinking with me in [[this site|this space]], which has been carefully crafted for idea discovery and a 2-way conversation.
